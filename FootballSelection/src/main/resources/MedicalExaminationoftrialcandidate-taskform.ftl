Can you ever imagine a Hindu becoming the CM of Muslim - majority J&K? --- ** In 1947, when India was partitioned, the Hindu population in Pakistan was about 24% ….Todayit is not even 1%. In 1947, the Hindu population in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was 30% …. Today it is about 7%. --- What happened to the missing Hindus? Do Hindus have human rights? --- ** In contrast, in India, Muslim population has gone up from 10.4% in 1951 to about 14% today; …whereas Hindu population has come down from 87.2% in 1951 to 85%in 1991. Do you still think that Hindus are fundamentalists? --- ** In Indiatoday Hindus are 85%. If Hindus are intolerant, how come Masjids and madrasas are thriving? How come Muslims are offering Namaz on the road?

Why Hindus cannot teach Gita or Ramayan in our schools? --- Do you admit that Hindus do have problems that need to be recognized? Or do you think that those who call themselves Hindus are themselves The problem? --- ** Why post -Godhra is blown out of proportion, when no-one talks of the ethnic cleansing of 4 lakh Hindus from Kashmir? --- ** Why Temple funds are spent for the welfare of Muslims and Christians, when they are free to spend their money in any way they like? --- ** When uniform is made compulsory for school children, why there is no Uniform Civil Code for citizens? --- ** In what way, J&K is different from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh, to have Article 370? --- Abdul Rehman Antuley was made a trustee of the famous Siddhi Vinayak Temple in Prabhadevi, Mumbai ….Can a Hindu - say Mulayam or Laloo – ever become a trustee of a Masjid or Madrasa? --- This is not prepared by/for any political party/group … these are the observations and facts.
